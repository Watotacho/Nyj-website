<h1>First blog:Abel and Patricia's marriage</h1>
</div>

<div class="column1">

<i><p> Abel married patricia though he wanted a traditional marriage and a traditional wife so that he can control her .A strong woman is never accepted in traditional African society .Abel was not lacky when got partricia a digital woman<br>
Partricia was independent woman who never accepted men to rule her.She was also not interested in practicing absturd African culture.When Patricia visited Abel's parent she refused to perform norms of the society<br>
Abel was not happy because according to his tradition woman should be submissive to her husband<br>patricia would not allow  man rule over her but Abel slowly stared bringing his own rules to the house.He kicked out their pet from the house.<br>
He even wanted to refuse Partricia to go to church<br>
When she went to meet Abels family she saw that women in Tzaneen were bowing down for men but she found it absurd.All the women from Tzaneen were staying at home because<br>
Abel want a traditional beacause in his culture women must bow and respect men always<br>
He want a traditional marriage beacause he want someone who always stay at home and cook for him beacause in Tzaneen society women were given maltitude of job during the day but men were resting after eating food<br>
Noah is dismayed when his stepfather, Abel, begins abusing him and his mother. This made Trover to run away from home because he don't want to see his family deteriorate<br>
Noah also learns a hard lesson about how South African society viewed female domestic violence victims when he saw how the local <br>
police discredited his motherâ€™s claims of abuse. Eventually, his mother leaves Abel after he nearly kills her<br>
This made Trover to run away from home because he don't want to see his family deteriorate<br>finally Partricia meets another man and leaves Abel who is furiuos and tries to murder her<br>At the end Abel shot Partricia in the head and miraculousily survives <br>
I also remember in Born a crime where Noah said he enjoy beating his wife<br>This is inhuman and we should stand together to do away with this arch culture<br>

<i><h1 >Second blog:Humor used by Trover in his story</h1></i> </div>
<div class="column2">
<i><p>Trevor was born in South Africa and he unravels the events through memories.Humor becomes a vehicle for pointing out at vices to individuals and the society at large.Trevor used humor to mock the rule of apartheid in his autobiography<br>
He was against appartheid because this rule leads to oppression and breakdown of the black society,family and individuals.expecially his mother faces more challenges as a woman and as a black person<br>
Trevor uses humour as a medium to unveil the existing human follies by presenting himself as an object of oppression and discrimination when his birth elicits fear to those around him <br>
Trevor use of humor aids in clearly portraying the dehumanizing conditions of individuals.He not only present his experiences but he also illuminates the harsh realities of multiracialism that disrupts the daily routines of black Africans in south Africa<br>
Trevor someone reason like andult and thus make his aoutobiography less convincing because he presents himself as a very courageous child who would question his elders.Trevor start this at home when he question  his mother's religion<br>
When his mother told him to go to church he could give his opinions why going to church was not the best idea at that moment he says"the lord knows that today we shouldn't go to church which is why he made sure the car would not start so that we stay at home as a family <br>
and take the day of rest because even God rested<br>


When his teacher ask him why he is not doing the home work,Trover could reply"I can't do my homework because i have work at home"<br>
Trover used humor when he said "my mum was genius.she was friend with a woman who was my skin color but a different race<br>
so she could get her to act like she was my mom and then my mom would walk with us in the the streets<br>
and act like she was my maid.she would act like she worked for us<br>
In the Tzaneen homeland the firstborn son almost becomes the father/husband by default because the dad is of working in the city<br>
"That is rubbish.Getting thrown out of moving car hurts"Trevor used humor when to describe how his mother threw him out through the window of a moving car to save his life.<br>
"No it was stupid"Trevor used humor when he was told that his dog is deaf.He said stupid beacause when ever he call panther and fufi.<br>
panther would come right away but fufi wouldn't do anything pg:97<br>
"My mother is as stubborn as she is religious"Trover used humor when he wanted to explain how his mother is good christian and they used to argue sundays beacuse Trevor don't going to church<br>
